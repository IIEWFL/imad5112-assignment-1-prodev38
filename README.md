This app will allow users to enter an age between 20 and 100 years old. The app will then compare the age to a list of famous figures. If the famous figure does exist, the app will display an appropriate message such as "You are 37 years old, which is the same age as Vincent van Gogh.\nVincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter whose work is known for its emotional intensity and bold colors." or "There is no historical figure known to be 15 years old!" if the age is not within our data base. 
How to use the app: 
  1. Enter an age between 20 and 100 years old in the edit text field.
  2. Click generate to get a result.
  3. Click the clear button if you wish to try a different age.
  4. Repeat from step 1.
